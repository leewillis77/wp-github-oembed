== Description ==

Plugin that allows you to embed details from github just by pasting in the URL as you would any other embed source. Currently supports:

* Repositories
* User profiles
* Project milestone summaries
* Project contributors

Coming soon:

* Gists...

The plugin provides very basic styling, but adds classes so you can style as you see fit. If anyone has some ideas for a better default stylesheet - pull requests welcome!

The main development is all going on on [GitHub](https://github.com/leewillis77/wp-github-oembed).
